I am an Electrical & Electronics Engineer with a strong passion for software development. My expertise lies in ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework, and related technologies. 

I specialize in developing clean code architecture using ASP.NET Core, C#, and Entity Framework. I have hands-on experience building RESTful APIs, implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and seamlessly integrating databases.

I am skilled in various software testing methodologies, including unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development (TDD). By embracing domain-driven design (DDD) principles, I create flexible and maintainable solutions that align with business requirements.

I am passionate about continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies and industry trends. Collaborative by nature, I thrive in team environments and excel at problem-solving through effective communication and teamwork.
