As an experienced industrial software developer with 8 years of experience across the Automotive, Metal Processing, and Food&Beverages sectors, I am currently seeking new opportunities as a Software Developer.

With expertise in C# and MS-SQL technologies, I have commissioned and developed test and production machines that can report effectively.

In addition, I have recently completed various courses and training, including MCSD Course in C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and MS-SQL, as well as front-end development courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Design Patterns for ASP.NET Core.

Moreover, I have experience in Microservices with .NET, Docker, Kubernetes, and self-study in OOP, SOLID, Algorithms, and Foundations.
